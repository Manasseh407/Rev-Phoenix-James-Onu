            About <span> Seed of Life Ministry</span>
          </h2>

          <p>
            Seed of Life Ministry was birthed from a profound vision and divine
            mandate received on August 18th, 1993. During a time of prayer, the
            Lord appeared in a vision, asking, “Who will weep over your land?”
            This question led to the founding of what is now known as the Global
            Prayer League in 1994. Today, the Global Prayer League operates over
            40 prayer centers across Nigeria, placing intercessors and
            gatekeepers over nations to spread God’s presence into cities and
            localities around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In April 1997, while in prayer in my office in Idah, I received
            another divine instruction: "Go and buy a file and begin to wait for
            preaching calls." This marked the beginning of my itinerant
            ministry, which has since taken me across Nigeria and beyond,
            preaching and teaching the Word of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            On May 26th, 2012, after a ministration at a CAN Women’s Programme
            in Ankpa, I received a prophetic word from a woman attending the
            event. She told me that the Lord had lamented that many of His
            ministers had failed in their missions and that He was sending me to
            the nations to represent Him. This divine message was soon confirmed
            as I began ministering in South Africa and other nations. In
            November 2022, Evangelist Sunday Oguche reiterated this call,
            affirming that the time for foreign missions was ripe, and I was to
            prepare to take the Word of God abroad.
          </p>
          <p>
            In June 2016, the Seed of Life Ministry transitioned from a rented
            facility in Wadata, Makurdi, to a newly acquired land in North Bank,
            Makurdi. At that time, the area had only a few small churches, and
            the Lord impressed upon me the vision to evangelize the community.
            After seeking counsel from respected spiritual fathers, including
            Papa Joseph Egwuda, Uncle Tor Ujaa, and Pastor Tokunbo Salami, and
            receiving divine confirmation through various prophetic witnesses,
            the decision was made to establish a church. In January 2017, the
            Seed of Life Chapel was officially inaugurated.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to our prayer and evangelistic work, Seed of Life
            Ministry is also working toward establishing a Bible Institute. This
            institute will train ministers and raise a labor force dedicated to
            advancing God's Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seed of Life Ministry stands as a testimony to God’s faithfulness,
            with a mission to spread His Word through intercession, evangelism,
            and teaching, both in Nigeria and across the world.
