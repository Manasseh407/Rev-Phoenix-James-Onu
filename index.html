            About <span> Seed of Life Ministry</span>
          </h2>
          
          <p>
            Seed of Life Ministry was birthed from a profound vision and divine
            mandate received on August 18th, 1993. During a time of prayer, the
            Lord appeared in a vision, asking, “Who will weep over your land?”
            This question led to the founding of what is now known as the Global
            Prayer League in 1994. </p> 
            <p>Today, the Global Prayer League operates over
            40 prayer centers across Nigeria, placing intercessors and
            gatekeepers over nations to spread God’s presence into cities and
            localities around the world.</p> 
            <p>In April 1997, while in prayer in my
            office in Idah, I received another divine instruction: "Go and buy a
            file and begin to wait for preaching calls." This marked the
            beginning of my itinerant ministry, which has since taken me across
            Nigeria and beyond, preaching and teaching the Word of God... </p>
